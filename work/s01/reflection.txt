I knew of some techniques but have already learnt more and refreshed the git console commands.
I had never before used the command which allows me to see upstreams and downstreams.

I have never created my own websites alone. 
I have however together in group created simple basic webserver websites using only html.

I have quite little experience of creating web applications. 
Some projects we have had to use websockets to connect to a weba application but I did not work on that part of the project.
My knowledge of the area around programming on the web is very limited but I do know that mostly HTML is used.
I know that CSS is used as a way to make websites look prettier.
Javascript can be used in websites as well to create certain commands.

Today I learned (refreshed) many of the commands that are used for git bash terminal.
I have learned to pull and push via git terminal.
The course covers alot more languages than I thought would be needed for web design.
I have learned that the first websites only used HTML and were completely text based.
CSS was developed as to make the websites look better and allow colours to the websites.
several other languages can now be used to make websites do methods like javascript.
