I knew of some techniques but have already learnt more and refreshed the git console commands.

I have never created my own websites alone. 
I have however together in group created simple basic webserver websites using only html.

I have quite little experience of creating web applications. 
Some projects we have had to use websockets to connect to a weba application but I did not work on that part of the project.
My knowledge of the area around programming on the web is very limited but I do know that mostly HTML is used.
I know that CSS is used as a way to make websites look prettier.
Javascript can be used in websites as well to create certain commands.

Today I learned (refreshed) many of the commands that are used for git bash terminal.
