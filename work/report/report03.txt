I have no prior experince working with JavaScript on the client side.
My experince working with JavaSccript is therefore very limitied.

I only know of Java well as another language.
I would say that there are quite many differences between JavaSccript and Java.
The formating of the code is quite different with JavaScript comparded to Java.
Semicolons are not a must have in JavaScript since it knows when an expressions ends.
The for loop looks the same however from what I have seen in examples.

In this exercise I have worked for the grade 3 since I wanted to have the task completed as soon as possible.
My intent has been to go for grade 4 or 5 if I got the time over to do so.
I added a car object on the me/report/about.html pages that functions in the same way by using the same Javascript to make it move.
I had some problems with the apache server program XAMPP which resulted in that I was denied the request (403) to see the school file I was fetching.
This lead me to use live server instead of XAMPP.

I have learned how to create HTML tables and how to add borders to them in order to make it look more pretty.
Learned how to Update pages dynamic without reloading the page.
I have learned how to use XAMPP to create a apache server on my computer.
