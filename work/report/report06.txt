JavaScript, Python and Java are some languages that are very popular right now.
JavaScript will probably always be popular since it is very common to use it when developing web pages and custom made scripts for other uses.
Python is a language that has is used much in machine learning and will probably keep being one of the most commun languages for programming.
Java is a great language since the use of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) alows programs written in Java to run on every system.
I belive they will all be at the top for popular languages since these languages has so much to offer.

I will probably learn Python at some point and continue with Java, I might aswell try to get base knowledge of the C++ or C# language but it will all depend on what jobs I can hope to get.
I would also in the future try to improve my exsisting knowledge about languages I already know.

I have compared Java, JavaScript and Python.
during the last 12 months Python has become more popular than Java and is the leading of the three.
JavaScript is the lower but it is still widely used and still very popular.
US, Canada and big part of the countries in Europe seems to prefer Python over Java according to google trends.
While Javascript is more popular in south America and in Africa.

If I were to recommend Java for example to my employer it would probably be for an application that needs to be run on several different systems, like on a phone.
Then with Java we could be able to with ease make it available for both android, apple and other systems that might need to have it integrateed with it.
I would try to bring up the positive aspects with the language or framework that I would be recommending and also wheter it could be a easy language/framework/technique to learn for the employees.
