I have had some minor experiences with HTML but not with CSS or JavaScript.
We have had a course where we developed minor sites by using web servers like apache.

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language that lets you write plaintext.
HTML lets the developer choose the structure of the website like headers and allows the use of pictures.
HTML is the standard langague made for websites.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that is used in order to make websites look prettier.
CSS is not needed for a website to be functional but may help it to look more inviting to the users.
JavaScript is a client-side programming language.
With JavaScript you can make custom client scripts.
Javascript alongside HTML and CSS can create web pages that function across various browsers, platform and devices.

A browser makes a request using HTTP and TCP or UDP to a web server to return a resource such as an image, video or webpage. 
Depending on the authenticity of the request, the server then returns the requested resource. 
For example, when you type google dot com in the address bar of the browser then a HTTP request is sent to the Google Server and if it detects that your request is legit then it accepts the request and returns the Google Search Page to you.

Today I have learned how the browser, HTTP protocol and web server interacts.
I have learned how to make footers and apply them.
I have learned how to change icons for a website.
