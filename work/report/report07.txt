I aimed for grade 3 during this exercise.
The exercise was much harder than the previous assignments.
Most of the hours went into the second part of the exercise, creating the webbapp and adding search routes to the accounts.
I am satisfied with the result since everyhing works.
I started off with working on the console part and had some trouble on how to surround the database with a nice looking texttable but when I undersood how I could do it it was quite easy.
The webbapp part could look better but it follows the reqiurements for a grade 3 which I feel is enough for the course.

The .NET Framework is a system component that is part of the operatingsystem Microsoft Windows.
In this framework C# and ASP.NET is a part of it.
ASP.NET is an open-source server-side web-application framework and it is designed for web development which allows the developer to produce dynamic web sites, applications and services.
C# is a language that is built thanks to the .NET framework. 
The .NET framework includes a large class library that provides language interoperability.
The language interoperability means that code languages can use code written in different languages.

From this exercise I have learned the basics of the .NET Framework and how to run them in both the console and on the webb.
How to initialize the dotnet applications from the console to load all required files for the startup.
How to create nice looking tables in the console with loops.
