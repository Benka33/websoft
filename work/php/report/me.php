<p><img src="img/me.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>My report page in web development. This page contains a presentation of myself.</p>

<p>Who am I?</p>

<p>My name is Filip Bengtsson and I am born and raised in the city of Kristianstad, I love video games and sports, I love climbing and it is a big hobby for me and I helped the startup of C4Climbing club in Kristianstad.</p>

<p>I got interested in programming when climbing abroad in Turkey since i meet a developer there that traveled while working which really peeked my interest in learning how to code myself.</p>

<p>I have tried many different sports when growing up, football was the one sport I played the most when younger but after 6 years I quit and a couple of years later
    I started playing american football, after around 4 years I grew tired of cummuting between my school and the training sessions so I quit american football and
    started climbing alot.
