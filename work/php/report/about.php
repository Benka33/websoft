<h1>About</h1>

<p>The website linked is the course plan for <a href="https://www.hkr.se/kurs/DA377B/kursplan">Software development for the webb</a>. </p>

<p>So far during this course we have covered how to work with git, mainly git bash. With this we have learned how to setup repos using the terminal only with 
    commands for adding new files and code to the repos. 
    
    This website is where my repports will be added during the course it also contatins information about me and who I am.
